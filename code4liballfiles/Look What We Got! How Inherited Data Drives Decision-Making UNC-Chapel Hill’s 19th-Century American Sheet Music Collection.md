# Look What We Got! How Inherited Data Drives Decision-Making: UNC-Chapel Hill’s 19th-Century American Sheet Music Collection
Renée McBride

Have you inherited a digital collection containing valuable, but inconsistent metadata? And wondered how to transform it into a usable, quality resource while accepting that it can’t meet your idea of perfection? This article describes such an experience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill University Library with its CONTENTdm-based 19th-Century American Sheet Music Collection, addressing issues such as field construction, the use of controlled vocabularies, development of a project data dictionary, and metadata clean-up.

## Introduction

In December 2009 the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill) University Library completed migrating its *[19th-Century American Sheet Music Collection](http://www.lib.unc.edu/dc/sheetmusic/)* – a collection of approximately 3,500 popular vocal and instrumental titles from the 19th century – from a locally developed PHP application backed by a MySQL database to CONTENTdm, a software package enabling libraries to manage and provide access to their digitized collections. UNC-Chapel Hill adopted CONTENTdm as its digital asset management system in 2005. Since then we have engaged in a broad effort to eliminate digital silos (e.g., collections in Access, FileMaker Pro, MySQL) by migrating them to CONTENTdm or our Millennium-based library catalog, and making them available through our information access platform Endeca, depending on the nature of the collection. Our goals in this area are to offer our users easier access to digital collections, to create more consistent workflows and interfaces across the collections, to extend the benefits of enhancements of one collection to all collections, and to achieve interoperability.

## Background

A brief history of our project is necessary to provide the context in which our migration and project decision-making took place. In the 1940s or early 1950s, 125 bound volumes of sheet music came to UNC-Chapel Hill’s Wilson Library, followed by a few additions in subsequent years, resulting in a total of 131 volumes, now housed in the UNC-Chapel Hill Music Library. Cataloging of various sorts occurred in the early 1950s and during the 1960s, and a major scanning and cataloging effort took place in the mid-1990s. In 2004 the collection was migrated from static HTML pages to a locally developed PHP/MySQL application and provided with a custom-made public interface. Scanning and cataloging continued in fits and starts and with a variety of staffing over the next few years. In 2008 serious planning for the migration of this collection to CONTENTdm began. A student from UNC-Chapel Hill’s School of Information and Library Science (SILS) exported the data from MySQL into a format that CONTENTdm could read and began a project wiki that we use to this day. Another SILS student loaded a backlog of previously scanned images – many of less than ideal quality – into CONTENTdm and helped with the process of rescanning images and getting them into CONTENTdm. The purpose of rescanning was to replace poor-quality with high-quality images. The rescanned images were created and stored in our digital archive as TIFF images, then converted to JPEG2000 in CONTENTdm, allowing for features such as loading only part of an image when zooming in on an image. In January 2009 I assumed management of the project. At that point in time we were in the process of rescanning images of music for which metadata had already been created. Once a volume was rescanned, the images were uploaded into CONTENTdm with their metadata. Rescanning was completed in April 2010. As of the writing of this article 121 of the 131 total volumes are completed, and we anticipate finishing all cataloging by June 2011.

As you may imagine, there was something of a lack of consistency in workflow, supervision, policies and procedures, and staffing over the many years this project has been in existence. By extension, there was also a lack of consistency in the quality of the metadata. Project staff ranged from librarians to SILS students to musicology graduate students. Once in a while, we struck gold with staff experienced in both cataloging and music. Students with systems expertise were invaluable in helping us learn how to scan, organize and transfer files, and work in CONTENTdm, but were rarely involved in creating metadata. The uncertainty of our staffing was a driving force behind some of the decisions we made in this project. The other primary factor was the amount of metadata of uneven quality that we inherited.

Two broad areas required decision-making and subsequent implementation before we could entertain the thought of going live with the CONTENTdm version of this collection: the technical area, responsible for the content of the collection, and the public interface area, responsible for offering an attractive and friendly product to our users. My primary area of responsibility was the technical area, although I consulted closely with our Public Services Music Librarian on both technical and public interface issues throughout the decision-making process. Additionally, we received invaluable input from student staff and systems librarians.

This article focuses on the following technical issues and areas of decision-making:

- which fields to retain, delete, or change;
- which Dublin Core fields our CONTENTdm fields would map to;
- which fields required controlled vocabularies;
- creating and maintaining a project-specific data dictionary;
- which fields could reasonably be cleaned up, and which we would choose to live with (or, as one of my systems colleagues put it, which fields offered us an “acceptable level of embarrassment”); and,
- decisions affecting browsability.

## Field Construction and Dublin Core Mapping

CONTENTdm allows complete freedom in the naming of fields. At UNC-Chapel Hill we maintain a general digital collection data dictionary that is dynamic, enabling the addition of fields as required by collections with specialized information, e.g., latitude and longitude for map collections, or artist for art-related collections. A very few of our digital collections exist in non-compliance with the data dictionary, for reasons such as the inheritance of metadata of uneven quality in an otherwise valuable collection, precisely the case with our *19th-Century American Sheet Music Collection*. Once we determined that this collection would exist, at least for the time being, outside our ideal digital collection world, we began the process of making decisions about its content.

The collection’s original 41 fields now number 35.

[![Figure 1: CONTENTdm Fields](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure1.png "Figure 1: CONTENTdm Fields")](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure1.png)

**Figure 1.** CONTENTdm Fields

Some decisions were fairly simple matters, such as deleting fields determined to have no use and containing highly inconsistent and confusing metadata. Examples of such fields were Series Instrumentation, Series Dates, and Series Description, none of which existed in any recent project staff’s memory. Over the years the terms “series” and “volume” appeared to have become tangled up with each other, so that by the time we were looking at these fields, they simply made no sense. We also did away with Publisher’s Quote, Colophon, and Advertisement, which contained no valuable metadata. We reduced five title fields to three fields, incorporated the Cover Design field into the Illustration field, and changed the names of two fields: Cover Inscription became Inscription, and Subject became Topic; these fields are discussed in more detail below. An exception to our general policy of deleting fields of questionable use and containing inconsistent and confusing metadata is the field labeled Unknown – by whom, when, and for what purpose no one knows. After determining that this field contains a variety of possibly useful information, we decided to retain the field but hide it from public view and not use it for current cataloging. We hope to be able to extract useful metadata from this field at a later time and move it to appropriate fields to enhance description and access.

We added a few fields to bring the collection partially in line with our digital collection practice:

- Type (resource type, i.e., Sheet music)
- Repository (entity responsible for publishing the digital object, i.e., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Music Library)
- Digital Collection (name of the digital collection of which the digital object is a part, i.e., 19th-Century American Sheet Music)
- Host (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)

More challenging were fields devoted to titles, illustrations, instrumentation, and topic.  
Our original five title fields:

- Full Title
- Short Title
- Caption Title
- Inside Title
- Other Titles

were compressed into three, hopefully less confusing, fields:

- Title (title proper)
- Caption Title (if different from Title)
- Other Titles (all other expressions of title)

The original fields Cover Design and Illustration were reduced to a single field, Illustration, incorporating selected content from Cover Design into Illustration (more on this in the following discussion of metadata clean-up). We also eliminated the earlier practice of describing such illustrations as calligraphic swashes and decorative designs, limiting the use of this field to descriptions of scenes, portraits, and photographs.

Originally there was an Instrumentation field and a Subject field, with a majority of Subject entries expressing in fact instrumentation or genre. We kept the Instrumentation field and changed the name of the Subject field to Topic, using it only for topics of vocal works. No vocabulary control had been applied to either of these fields, resulting in many conflicting headings for the same concept, e.g., Choir music and Choral music, or Solo song and Solo voice. Our primary purposes in all our decision-making were to simplify both the user’s understanding of the metadata and project staff’s creation of metadata. As we made decisions about field construction, we took efforts to create self-explanatory field labels.

Concomitant with the construction of our fields was their mapping to Dublin Core fields (see the “DC map” column of Figure 1). Our CONTENTdm collections are harvested by the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH), which employs Dublin Core as its common metadata format, allowing the sharing of digital collections created in varying metadata formats. Once mapped to Dublin Core, data can be harvested by anyone who has adopted OAI-PMH.

## Controlled Vocabularies and Data Dictionary

CONTENTdm contains several thesauri, e.g., the Getty Research Institute’s Art & Architecture Thesaurus, the Library of Congress’s (LC) Thesaurus for Graphic Materials I, and MeSH (the U.S. National Library of Medicine’s Medical Subject Headings). It does not contain nor can it be connected to the LC Name Authority File (LCNAF) or LC Subject Headings (LCSH). Therefore, we enabled controlled vocabularies for the fields for which authority control and consistent metadata quality were most important. Such control is important not only for consistent search results, but also for public browse capability. A crucial question we addressed was: What fields do we want our users to be able to browse?

[![Figure 2: Sheet music collection opening screen](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure2.png "Figure 2: Sheet music collection opening screen")](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure2.png)

**Figure 2.** Sheet music collection opening screen

The fields for which we offer browsing capability are shown in Figure 2. Effective browsability requires that metadata be consistently applied, therefore browsable fields tend to have controlled vocabularies. For example, a sheet music researcher could likely be interested in studying the history of music publishing in a particular location and would find the ability to browse this collection by publisher location highly useful.

[![Figure 3: Browse by Location](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure3.png "Figure 3: Browse by Location")](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure3.png)

**Figure 3.** Browse by Location

When a field is made browsable, a hyperlinked, alphabetical listing of the contents of that field throughout the entire digital collection is made available to the user. If this particular vocabulary were not controlled, state abbreviations would appear in various forms, as would names of non-U.S. cities, e.g., Mainz and Mayence, Germany, and Brussels and Bruxelles, Belgium. The same logic extends to providing reliable browsing of, for instance, composer and lyricist names.

As we made controlled vocabulary decisions, we developed guidelines for creating entries for all fields, controlled or not, in the form of a project-specific data dictionary. \[[1](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/#note1)\] (See [Appendix A](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/#noteA) for Data Dictionary.)

As with our decisions regarding field construction, our primary purpose in creating the data dictionary was to simplify the creation of metadata for project staff. Our fundamental principles in the construction of the data dictionary were simplicity and consistency. These principles allowed us to make steady progress dealing with a mass of inherited metadata of uneven quality with no control mechanisms, and to successfully handle our situation of uncertain staffing, which required fairly frequent training of new, and always temporary, project staff.

Clearly, names need to be controlled, so we enabled controlled vocabularies for our four name fields:

- Composer
- Lyricist
- Arranger
- Lithographer, Engraver, or Artist

After completing metadata clean-up (to be discussed later) of the name fields, we combined the originally four separate name controlled vocabularies into one large shared controlled vocabulary that contains all the names used in these four fields. Due to the sheer number of names we inherited, we couldn’t consider bringing them all into conformity with LCNAF, AACR2, and local digital collection practice. But we could ensure consistency within the database, making sure that one, and only one, form of each name exists in the controlled vocabulary, and adding new metadata according to the guidelines laid out in our data dictionary. As much as possible, we drew on previous project practice as our guide to constructing names in order to avoid recreating everything from scratch, and we formalized practice in the data dictionary. The “Comments” column of our data dictionary contains instructions about how to construct names, with examples given in the “Content Examples” column and guidance about where in the musical score to locate name fields metadata in the “Vocabulary Source” column.

Other fields for which we enabled controlled vocabularies are:

- Publisher; Publisher Location: Left uncontrolled, these fields would give users unpredictable search results, and their browse views would be a mess, with geographical terms such as state abbreviations and names of foreign cities appearing in various forms. As with personal and corporate names, we did not follow LCNAF and AACR2 practice, but ensured consistency within the database.
- Topic: We fairly quickly decided against using LCSH for our Topic field due to training challenges with our frequently changing project staff. LCSH is simply too complex to use with student staff that experiences regular turnover. After considering several thesauri, we decided to rely on Wikipedia, with Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (available via our Library’s website) as our backup. Wikipedia has served our needs beautifully. Wikipedia concisely describes the usually simple topics addressed by vocal works in our collection, e.g., Christmas, Death, Loneliness, and Patriotism. More complex topics are expressed much more simply by Wikipedia than LCSH, e.g., American Civil War vs. United States—History—Civil War, 1861-1865; Battle of Prague (1757) vs. Prague, Battle of, Prague, Czech Republic, 1757; and Silver standard vs. Bimetallism, or Silver question, or Currency question, or Money, or Coinage. As in other areas of decision-making, we chose Wikipedia as our primary topical thesaurus in order to simplify the creation of metadata for project staff, as well as to easily ensure consistency in the Topic field.
- Volume: Consistency in this field is most important to staff working behind the scenes. For instance, when we uploaded rescanned images with their metadata, we had to make sure that the volume part of the image file names exactly matched the volume numbering in the metadata, which in turn had to be consistent throughout the individual records for the musical works from each volume. Additionally, a public use is served when someone wants to look at the contents of a full volume, as at least one local musicology professor assigns his students to do.
- Type; Repository; Digital Collection; Host: These fields contain constant data, so enabling controlled vocabularies for them ensures consistency, as well as enables extremely easy metadata input for these fields. The cataloger simply double clicks on the entry in the controlled vocabulary, and the field is accurately populated.

## Metadata Clean-up

When metadata clean-up could be accomplished using CONTENTdm’s “Find & replace” function, we were able to tackle large amounts of data. The function “Find and replace a single field” served our needs best, since we attacked clean-up on a field-by-field basis.

[![Figure 4: Find & replace function](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure4.png "Figure 4: Find & replace function")](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure4.png)

**Figure 4.** Find & replace function

Additionally, making changes across all fields is a high risk activity for the reason that words or phrases needing correction in some fields occasionally occur in contexts not requiring correction. When clean-up could be achieved only one record at a time, we cleaned up fields involving manageable amounts of data, but sometimes had to opt for the “acceptable level of embarrassment.”

Examples of large clean-up efforts include the following fields:

- Composer; Lyricist; Arranger; Lithographer, Engraver, or Artist
- Topic
- Illustration

Once guidelines for creating names were established and controlled vocabularies for each name field were enabled, clean-up began with the controlled vocabularies. Controlled vocabularies were originally populated with the existing contents of their corresponding fields. Many names appeared in multiple forms, so duplicate forms were deleted after the authoritative form was selected. When the controlled vocabulary was clean, we proceeded to cleaning up that field’s metadata, accomplished by using the “Find & replace” function mentioned above. The incorrect form of name was entered in the “find” box, and the correct form in the “replace with” box. Once this process was completed, we ran the Verify command for that field, comparing a field’s metadata across all records with the field’s associated controlled vocabulary.

[![Figure 5: CONTENTdm Verify command](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure5.png "Figure 5: CONTENTdm Verify command")](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure5.png)

**Figure 5.** CONTENTdm Verify command

Ideally the Verify command delivers zero results:

[![Figure 6: Verify results](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure6.png "Figure 6: Verify results")](https://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue13/mcbride/figure6.png)

**Figure 6.** Verify results

Results indicate a mismatch, telling us one of two things: 1) an error exists in the metadata, or 2) metadata exists that has not been added to the controlled vocabulary. When we achieved zero results from the Verify command, that field’s clean-up was completed. To this day we run the Verify command on fields with controlled vocabularies on a monthly basis as a method of quality control.

Once all name fields were cleaned up, we combined the four separate controlled vocabularies into a single shared controlled vocabulary containing all the names used in the four fields. Using a shared controlled vocabulary has proven helpful in streamlining data entry for these fields, because some names appear in multiple name fields. For example, the composer of a work might also have written the lyrics to that work, and might have arranged other works.

As mentioned earlier, the Topic field was originally called Subject. We renamed the Subject field Topic, hoping to make it clearer that this field is used only for songs about a specific topic. We removed all non-topical terms from the controlled vocabulary, corrected terms in the controlled vocabulary as appropriate, then cleaned up metadata using the “Find & replace” function. It is possible that some records that would benefit from the Topic field are lacking it. In addition to making sure that correct topical terms were used, this metadata clean-up required removing numerous instrumentation and genre terms from the Topic field of records. Because of the magnitude of this problem, we were unable to move those terms into the Instrumentation field of their records, a task that would have required record-by-record editing. The information was simply deleted so that the Topic field would be clean across the database. This is an excellent example of a less than ideal decision made when the amount of inconsistent inherited metadata was simply too large to fix. What we did fix was the general integrity of the database.

In contrast to the problem described above with the Instrumentation field, we were able to transfer valuable metadata from the original Cover Design field to the Illustration field because it was of a manageable amount, although the transfer of metadata did have to be done one record at a time. Our Public Services Music Librarian reviewed the contents of the Cover Design field to determine what metadata should be retained. This metadata was moved to the Illustration field and the Cover Design field subsequently deleted.

Once metadata clean-up was completed, we knew that every detail wasn’t as perfect as it might have been if we had designed things from scratch, but we also knew that the database was in stunningly better condition than when we had begun.

## The Future

As pleased as we are with the current state of the *19th-Century American Sheet Music Collection*, we have plans and hopes for future improvements. Most immediate is making the collection accessible via the [Sheet Music Consortium](http://digital.library.ucla.edu/sheetmusic/), “a group of libraries working toward the goal of building an open collection of digitized sheet music using the Open Archives Initiative:Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI:PMH).” \[[2](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/#note2)\] More labor intensive, but nevertheless attainable, goals are to bring names into compliance with LCNAF and topics with LCSH, which would bring the collection in line with our local digital collection practice. The importance of these goals lies in the fact that the UNC-Chapel Hill Library plans to make CONTENTdm collections available via Endeca, which offers relevance-ranked keyword search results as well as faceted navigation built on existing library metadata. It is highly undesirable to include collections lacking the authority control applied to names and subjects in our Millennium-based library catalog. Although our CONTENTdm collections will not actually reside in Millennium, the distinction between Millennium and Endeca is not apparent to our users, nor should it be. An Endeca search retrieves integrated results, providing access to a variety of the Library’s collections, not just those cataloged in the MARC format. A current example of such resources available via Endeca is our EAD finding aids for special collections. A final hope for improving the sheet music collection is to populate the Instrumentation field in all records.

When the scanning and cataloging of all 131 volumes of sheet music is completed, we will turn our attention to improving an imperfect but highly usable and consistent collection. Inherited projects like the *19th-Century American Sheet Music Collection* present many challenges, some that cannot be resolved in an ideal manner, but the collections are nonetheless valuable. As heir to such a project, we strove to improve the weakest parts of the project and to ensure quality from the present day forward.
